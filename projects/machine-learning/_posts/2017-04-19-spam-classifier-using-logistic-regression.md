title: Spam Classifier Using Logistic Regression
category: ml
---

This project uses Logistic Regression to classify emails into *spam* and *ham* (non-spam).
The classifier is trained on 5172 samples of email, each of which is converted into a feature vector based on a set of words most commonly found in spam emails. Logistic regression is a discriminative algorithm that in this context, models the probability of an email being spam given certain features. 

Here's the [demo](https://spam-classifier.herokuapp.com/) (it may take a while to load).

The files for the project are available [here](https://github.com/simpeijie/spam-classifier-app).
