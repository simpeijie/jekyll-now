title: Shell

This project involves building a shell that allows users to run and manage programs. The shell provides basic functionalities similar to that of a Bash shell, such as switching directories, redirecting input/output and handling signals. Here's the link to the code: [shell](https://github.com/simpeijie/CS162-Operating-Systems/tree/master/shell)

### Support for ***cd*** and ***pwd***

The shell supports a number of built-in commands, which are functions in the shell itself, not external programs. The program supports **pwd** that prints the current working directory to standard output as well as **cd** that takes one argument, a directory path, and changes the current working directory to that directory.

### Program Execution

The shell can also be used to execute programs. With path resolution, changing a directory works on absolute and relative paths, i.e. typing the full path of a directory VS. the directory to switch to relative to the current directory. 

The image below shows the execution of a [word count](https://github.com/simpeijie/CS162-Operating-Systems/tree/master/word_count) program resembling the Unix word count command.

*Note: The word count program displays the number of lines, number of words, followed by the number of characters in a file*

### Input/Output Redirection

When executing programs, it is sometimes useful to provide input from a file or to direct output to afile. The syntax "[process] > [file]" redirects the process's standard output to a file. Similarly, "[process] < [file]" feeds the content of a file to the process's standard input.

### Signal Handling and Terminal Control

The shell is also capable of foreground and background switching of processes. For example, when the word count program is being run, invoking **CTRL-C** does not kill the shell entirely, instead it terminates only the word count program. In essence, every process is started in its own process group and placed in the foreground. Stopping signals only affects the foregrounded program, not the backgrounded shell.

A screenshot of how that works is shown below.

### Conclusion

Apart from the "built-in" commands like `ls`, `?`, `exit` etc. that a shell can handle, the shell above can also execute external programs just like any other shells would.
